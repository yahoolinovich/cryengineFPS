# cryengineFPS

A personal FPS project in cryEngine. I'm currently working on a momentum based system with wallrunning.

Update June 13:

Basic Wallrunning is implemented, along with a double jump to make wall jumping more controllable:

Still need to implement camera effects while wallrunning as well as modify the wall jump so the player jumps towards the wall's normal direction.

Update June 14:

Wall jump implemented. While the player is wallrunning, if the player jumps; the player will jump towards the wall's normal direction making it easier for the player to chain jumps together from opposing directions.
